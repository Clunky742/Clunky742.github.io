    <div class="dribble">
        <h2>Dribbling</h2>
        <p>The dribble in basketball is the most important fundamental. Without this ability you won’t be able to move up and down the court. Dribbling is going to be your way of maneuvering between opponents and even teammates to find a window for scoring. Scoring gets you points and getting points means you have a better chance of winning games. So, therefore we must start with learning how to dribble the ball.</p>

    <div class="Shoot">
        <h2>Shooting</h2>
        <p>Now you know dribbling is the key to finding that small window of scoring but how exactly do we score and get those points? Shooting the ball. Shooting is another essential trait for basketball. You can pass, dribble, and hold the ball as much as you want. But none of those talents are going to get you points.</p>

    <div class="rules">
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>We have learned the most needed skills for basketball. Now we can start to learn the basic rules. The basic rules of basketball are quite simple. Although simple, they always seem to rile players up when they are called for fouls. So yes, they are simple, but you can also say they are easily forgotten. How are rules simple yet forgotten? Well, when you are in the middle of a game and your adrenaline is pumping it’s almost like you’ve blacked out and become another person. Once that happens sometimes a couple of “simple” rules don’t matter anymore. Just scoring more points.</p>

        <p>Basic Rules</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You must dribble to continue moving the ball</li>
            <li>You only have 2 steps before you must dribble again</li>
            <li>You can't hit someones hand when trying to take the ball</li>
        </ol>
