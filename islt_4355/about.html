        <h2>The "About Me" Page</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Carter! I’m a 22-year-old senior at the University of Missouri studying IST. IST stands for Information Science Technology. Studying IST has been fun, but I still don’t know what I want to do in the future. I love the IT world and the opportunities that I still haven’t discovered yet. What I don’t love is feeling like I’m not good enough to work with code. Hopefully, I can find that spark of motivation and confidence soon. This is my last year at Mizzou, so I am running out of time to decide. More recently I found out that I have a lot of fun doing <em>web design</em>. Since I realized how much joy I get from coding websites I thought I would take web development next. It’s still early but I have a hunch that by the end of this class I will appreciate what I was able to take away from it.<br/></p>
