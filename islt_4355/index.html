        <h3>Welcome and thank you for visiting my website, “How To Play Basketball”!</h3>
        <p>Your journey through this site will help you learn the fundamentals of basketball. These fundamentals are going to consist of dribbling, shooting, and basic rules. Dribbling is the most important skill you’ll learn. Shooting the ball is going to be the hardest skill you’ll learn. And finally, you’ll learn the basic rules for the game of basketball. My main purpose is obvious but, my other goal is for all users to go out and show off the new skills they have learned. Another hope of mine is that basketball becomes a new hobby for any user of the site like it has for me. After gaining a new confidence on the court people will start to spread the word about my website. In the end, I want this site to create a never-ending cycle of adding new blood to the basketball scene. </p>
        <p>I am studying IST. Estimated date of graduation is December 1st. This is all being complete at the University of Missouri - Columbia.</p>
